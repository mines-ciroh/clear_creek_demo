Similar to the CFE, there needs to be a configuration file for all 119 basins. At the moment,
there is a script that generates one for all of the basins using "clear_creek.yml" as the template.
That being said, I have only uploaded the template for now instead of uploading 119 versions
of the same template.

I have uploaded the script that generates all of them.
