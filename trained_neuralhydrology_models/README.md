This project is being implemented on a Wendian CSOM server. Because of this, there
are a couple notes that should be mentioned:

- The LSTM files are currently in completely different paths as shown here (also seen in the realization file)
- Trained NH models from Jonathan Frame are being used as well: https://github.com/jmframe/lstm/tree/master
- This only shows the NH model I trained on Clear Creek
  - I have currently only uploaded the config file
- I have scripts, environments, and executables setup to run Neural Hydrology and NextGen accordingly
