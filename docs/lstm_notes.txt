This fork/branch is meant to include the important files for the LSTM NextGen implementation for Clear Creek.
The important files have been organized similarly to how they are for CFE and NOAH-Modular in the main repository.
How they are currently setup on Wendian is different, so paths in the files may not be the same as the repo. 

An LSTM in NextGen requires at least 3 different configuration files:
  - A trained LSTM in "trained_neuralhydrology_models" directory
  - A BMI configuration file in "inputs/settings/06719505/lstm_bmi_config"
  - A realization file in "config/06719505"

NextGen runs with the "run_clear_ck_lstm.sh" file, which uses the realization file to determine what parameters to use.
The realization file calls the BMI config files to pass in specific information about the basin and LSTM. The BMI config
file points to the trained LSTM config file. The LSTM is then initialized with the parameters in its config file and grabs
the LSTM weights from the specified directory.
