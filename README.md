# clear_creek_demo
A NextGen pilot implementation for Clear Creek at Golden, Colorado

## Synopsis
This single-basin hydrologic modeling application for the Clear Creek at Golden, CO ([USGS 06719505](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/06719505/#parameterCode=00060&period=P365D&showMedian=false)) watershed is a sandbox for experimentation and development using the NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework. The application will include real-time and retrospective model simulation, short-range to seasonal forecasting, and other eco-hydro-climate analyses.  Some components of the associated code will be hosted in other repos. NextGen and this modeling implementation have been installed and runs on the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) Wendian HPC.
